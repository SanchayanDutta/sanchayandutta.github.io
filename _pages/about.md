Iâ€™m a second year graduate student interested in the mathematical foundations of quantum information and quantum error correction. I am fortunate to be advised by both <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~greg/" target="_blank">Greg Kuperberg</a> and <a href= "http://www.isaackimquantum.com" target="_blank"> Isaac Kim</a>.

Previously, I was an undergrad at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Jadavpur University, India from 2017 to 2021. I was also an undergraduate research assistant in the Department of Physical Sciences, IISER Kolkata.

I can be reached at `dutta[at]ucdavis.edu`.
