Iâ€™m a first year graduate student interested in the mathematical foundations of quantum computing and quantum information theory. My advisor is <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~greg/" target="_blank">Greg Kuperberg</a>.

Previously, I was an undergrad at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Jadavpur University, India from 2017 to 2021. I was also an undergraduate research assistant in the Department of Physical Sciences, IISER Kolkata.
