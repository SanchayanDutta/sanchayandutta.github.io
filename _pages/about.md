I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at UC Davis.

My primary area of research interest is the mathematical foundations of theoretical quantum computing, which spans various fields such as quantum codes and fault tolerance, quantum algebra, geometric topology, computational complexity, and operator algebras.

Lately, I have also developed an interest in the mathematical and geometrical structures that underlies machine learning and optimization, and I am eager to delve further into this field.

I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~greg" target="_blank">Greg Kuperberg</a>. This Summer 2023 I am a visiting graduate researcher at Harvard University, fortunate to be hosted by <a href="https://anuraganshu.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Anurag Anshu</a>.

Previously, I was an undergrad at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Jadavpur University, India from 2017 to 2021. I was also an undergraduate research assistant in the Department of Physical Sciences, IISER Kolkata.

You may reach me at `dutta[at]ucdavis.edu`. My office is at MSB 3219. 

We run a couple of weekly reading groups at UC Davis on <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucdavis.edu/quantumalgebragroup" target="_blank">Quantum Algebra</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucdavis.edu/computationalcomplexitygroup" target="_blank">Computational Complexity</a> in hybrid-mode. If you'd like to join us kindly drop me an email.
