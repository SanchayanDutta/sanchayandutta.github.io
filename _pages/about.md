Iâ€™m a second year graduate student in mathematics at UC Davis. I'm interested in the mathematical foundations of quantum error correction and quantum information. 

I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~greg" target="_blank">Greg Kuperberg</a> and am also a member of <a href="https://www.isaackimquantum.com" target="_blank">Isaac Kim</a>'s group.

Previously, I was an undergrad at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Jadavpur University, India from 2017 to 2021. I was also an undergraduate research assistant in the Department of Physical Sciences, IISER Kolkata.

You can reach me at `dutta[at]ucdavis.edu`. My office is at MSB 3219.
