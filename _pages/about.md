I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at UC Davis, specializing in the mathematical foundations of theoretical quantum computing. This broad field encompasses quantum codes, fault tolerance, quantum algebra, geometric topology, computational complexity, and operator algebras. Lately, my interests have expanded into the mathematical and geometrical structures inherent in machine learning and optimization.

I have the unique privilege of being advised by <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~greg" target="_blank">Greg Kuperberg</a>. This Summer 2023 I am a visiting graduate researcher at Harvard University, fortunate to be hosted by <a href="https://anuraganshu.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Anurag Anshu</a>.

Previously, I was an undergrad at the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Jadavpur University, India from 2017 to 2021. I was also an undergraduate research assistant in the Department of Physical Sciences, IISER Kolkata.

You may reach me at `dutta[at]ucdavis.edu`. My office is at MSB 3219.

We run a couple of weekly reading groups at UC Davis on <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucdavis.edu/quantumalgebragroup" target="_blank">Quantum Algebra</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucdavis.edu/computationalcomplexitygroup" target="_blank">Computational Complexity</a> in hybrid-mode. If you'd like to join us kindly drop me an email.
