<h3>Current Research</h3>

<font size="-1"> [UC Davis, 2021 - *] My current research focus with Greg is studying anyonic software fault-tolerance and quantum algebra, especially but not only in relation to Turaev-Viro codes.
I'm also interested in investigating the landscape of algebraic geometry quantum codes and comparing it to the recent progress in quantum LDPC codes.</font>
<br>
<font size="-1"> [Summer 2023] I'm hosted by Anurag Anshu at Harvard University and working on establishing a connection between explicit lower bounds on SoS instances and the NLTS theorem.
With Suvrit Sra, at TU Munich, I'm working on the mathematics of linear transformers. Previously, I worked with his group on Riemannian bilevel optimization. This is part of my side interest in machine learning. </font>
