<h3>Research Notes</h3>

<font size="-1"> [UC Davis, 2021 - *] My current research focus with Greg is studying anyonic software fault-tolerance and quantum algebra, especially but not only in relation to Turaev-Viro codes.
I'm also interested in investigating the landscape of algebraic geometry quantum codes and comparing it to the recent progress in quantum LDPC codes.</font>

<font size="-1"> [Summer 2023] I'm hosted by Anurag Anshu at Harvard University and working on establishing a connection between explicit lower bounds on SoS instances and the NLTS theorem.
With Suvrit Sra, at MIT, I'm working on developing Riemannian bilevel optimization problems and algorithms. This is part of my side interest in machine learning. </font>
