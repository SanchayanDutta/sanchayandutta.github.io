<h3>Research Notes</h3>

<font size="-1"> My current research focus with Greg is studying the landscape of quantum Gilbert-Varshamov codes and comparing it to the recent progress in the landscape of quantum LDPC codes. With Isaac I'm investigating constructions of non-uniform error models on surface codes. The latter is partly in collaboration with Cisco. </font>
