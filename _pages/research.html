<h3>Research Notes</h3>

<font size="-1"> My current research focus with Greg is studying the landscape of algebraic geometry quantum codes and comparing it to the recent progress in the landscape of quantum LDPC codes. With Isaac Kim I'm investigating construction of T-gates by embedding surfaces codes in higher dimensional codes. </font>
